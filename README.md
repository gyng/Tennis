# Tennisity

A super-rushed and quick hack for an NUS NM4210 User Experience group project. Uses [Sensorendipity](https://sensorendipity.github.io/)<sup>1</sup>.

Tennisity is an application intended to help amateur tennis players master their serves by providing timely, hard data on their serves.

After attaching an Android device (for sensors) to a tennis racquet, a player&rsquo;s serves can be detected. Data on those serves are relayed back to the player for review right after each serve.

I didn&rsquo;t put too much effort and time into this, so serve detection is *not that good*.

## Requirements

* Android (for Sensorendipity)
* Sensorendipity app, a sensor prototyping tool
* Modern browser with JavaScript

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository somewhere
2. Install and start Sensorendipity on the Android device acting as the sensors
3. Load `app/index.html` in a browser (on the Android device itself, if you like!)
