# Tennisity

Quick, WIP hack for a NUS NM4210 group project. Requires [Sensorendipity](https://sensorendipity.github.io/).

Tennisity is an application intended to help amateur tennis players master their serves by providing timely, hard data on their serves.

After attaching an Android device (for sensors) to a tennis racquet, a player's serves can be detected. Data on those serves are relayed back to the player for review right after each serve.

# Usage
